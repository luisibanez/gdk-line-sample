## Running the sample on Glass

You can use your IDE to compile and install the sample or use
[`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html)
on the command line:

    $ adb install -r LineSample.apk

To start the sample, say "ok glass, show a line" from the Glass clock
screen or use the touch menu.

This was based on the example :  gdk-compass-sample

https://github.com/googleglass/gdk-compass-sample

and modified to make it a minimalistic example.
